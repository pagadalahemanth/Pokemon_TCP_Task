# Pokemon_TCP_Task
Fetching the Pokemon details or their characteristics

through this Open source API  PokeAPI. Make different cards for each Pokemon and on each card show their pictures, their names, etc.

Candidates can make a “read more” button on a Pokemon card, by clicking those buttons users will get to know more things about each Pokemon.

To generate more and more Pokemons, create a button “Load more”, on clicking that button, users will get to see more Pokemon cards.

All these characteristics and Pokemon profiles should be stored in the database and all activities should happen via  CRUD operations.

Choice of database is open but preferred is Postgres with sequelize library.
